        </ul>

    <h2 class="column-heading">Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="analysis-findings">
        <ul>
            <li>We could see that the matches were held in stadiums within main cities like <b><em>Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad.</em></b></li>
            <li>Matches only between 60-70 for a year.</li>
            <li>Toss winning and Match winning do not correlate and there is not that much causation.</li>
        </ul>
